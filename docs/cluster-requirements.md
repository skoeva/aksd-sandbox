# AKS Cluster Requirements for AKS desktop

This guide describes the cluster configuration needed for the best experience with AKS desktop. **[AKS Automatic](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/intro-aks-automatic)** clusters meet all requirements out of the box and require no additional setup. If you are using an **AKS Standard** cluster, review the sections below to ensure your cluster is configured correctly.

AKS desktop requires an Azure subscription. If you're new to Azure, [free trials are available](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/free-services).

## Minimum requirements

> **Note:** AKS Automatic clusters meet all of the following requirements out of the box. If you're using AKS Automatic, you can skip ahead to the [Recommended configuration](#recommended-configuration) section.

These are hard requirements. AKS desktop will not function with AKS clusters that lack them.

| Requirement | Why it is needed | How to check | How to enable |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Microsoft Entra ID (AAD) authentication** | Required for Azure RBAC and managed namespace role assignments. Clusters without Entra ID authentication enabled do not appear in the AKS desktop cluster picker. | `az aks show -g <rg> -n <cluster> --query aadProfile` -- must not be `null` | Must be set at cluster creation: `--enable-aad --enable-azure-rbac` |
| **Azure RBAC for Kubernetes authorization** | Required for assigning users to projects with Admin, Writer, or Reader roles. | `az aks show -g <rg> -n <cluster> --query aadProfile.enableAzureRbac` -- must be `true` | Must be set at cluster creation: `--enable-azure-rbac` |
| **aks-preview CLI extension** | Required for `az aks namespace` commands used to create managed namespaces (AKS Projects). | `az extension show --name aks-preview` | AKS desktop installs this automatically if it is missing. To install manually: `az extension add --name aks-preview` |

> **Preview feature:** AKS Projects use the [AKS Managed Namespace](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/manage-namespaces) preview feature. Your subscription must have the `ManagedNamespacePreview` feature flag registered. AKS desktop checks for this automatically and will prompt you to register the feature if it is missing. Organizations that restrict the use of preview features should review their policies before enabling this.

## Recommended configuration

These addons and settings are optional but strongly recommended. Without them, specific AKS desktop features will be unavailable or degraded.

| Feature | What it enables in AKS desktop | Can be enabled after cluster creation? | How to enable |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Network policy engine** (Cilium recommended) | Ingress and egress network policies on managed namespaces. Without a network policy engine, policies are silently ignored. | **No** -- must be set at cluster creation. | `--network-plugin azure --network-policy cilium` |
| **Azure Monitor Metrics** (Managed Prometheus) | Metrics tab (CPU, memory, and request-rate charts) and the Scaling chart (CPU %). | Yes | `az aks update -g <rg> -n <cluster> --enable-azure-monitor-metrics` |
| **Managed Grafana** | Visualization for metrics dashboards. | Yes | Enabled alongside Azure Monitor Metrics when using the Azure Portal. Via CLI, link a Grafana workspace with `--enable-azure-monitor-metrics --azure-monitor-workspace-resource-id <id>`. |
| **KEDA** | Kubernetes Event-Driven Autoscaling in the Scaling tab. | Yes | `az aks update -g <rg> -n <cluster> --enable-keda` |
| **VPA** (Vertical Pod Autoscaler) | Vertical pod autoscaling recommendations in the Scaling tab. | Yes | `az aks update -g <rg> -n <cluster> --enable-vpa` |

## Feature availability matrix

The table below is a quick reference showing which AKS desktop features work when specific cluster addons are missing.

| AKS desktop feature | Works without addon? | Required addon | Can be enabled after cluster creation? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Project creation | Yes | Azure RBAC + Entra ID | No (creation-time only) |
| Network policies | No (silently ignored) | Cilium, Calico, or Azure network policy | No (creation-time only) |
| Metrics tab | No (shows error) | Managed Prometheus | Yes |
| Scaling chart (CPU %) | No (shows error) | Managed Prometheus | Yes |
| HPA (horizontal scaling) | Yes | metrics-server (included by default) | Yes |
| KEDA scaling | No | KEDA addon | Yes |
| VPA scaling | No | VPA addon | Yes |

## Creating a fully compatible AKS Standard cluster

The following command creates a Standard-tier AKS cluster with all recommended features enabled:

```bash
az aks create \
  --resource-group <resource-group> \
  --name <cluster-name> \
  --location <location> \
  --tier standard \
  --enable-aad \
  --enable-azure-rbac \
  --network-plugin azure \
  --network-policy cilium \
  --enable-azure-monitor-metrics \
  --enable-keda \
  --enable-vpa \
  --enable-hpa \
  --generate-ssh-keys
```

Replace `<resource-group>`, `<cluster-name>`, and `<location>` with your own values. A cluster created with these flags will support every AKS desktop feature without additional configuration.

## Enabling features on an existing cluster

Some features can be added to an existing cluster after creation. However, the **network policy engine cannot be changed after cluster creation**. If your cluster was created without a network policy engine, you must create a new cluster with the `--network-policy cilium` flag for full network policy support.

### Enable Azure Monitor Metrics (Managed Prometheus)

```bash
az aks update -g <rg> -n <cluster> --enable-azure-monitor-metrics
```

This enables the Metrics tab and the Scaling chart (CPU %) in AKS desktop.

### Enable KEDA addon

[Kubernetes Event-Driven Autoscaling (KEDA)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/keda-about) is a lightweight component that makes application autoscaling simple.

```bash
az aks update -g <rg> -n <cluster> --enable-keda
```

This enables KEDA-based autoscaling in the Scaling tab.

### Enable VPA addon

The [Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/vertical-pod-autoscaler) automatically adjusts pod resource requests based on observed usage.

```bash
az aks update -g <rg> -n <cluster> --enable-vpa
```

This enables VPA recommendations in the Scaling tab.

> **Note:** These commands may take several minutes to complete. Each addon may incur additional Azure costs. See [AKS pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/kubernetes-service/) for details.

## AKS Automatic vs AKS Standard

[AKS Automatic](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/intro-aks-automatic) clusters come with all of the above features preconfigured and require no additional setup. If you do not need fine-grained control over your cluster configuration, AKS Automatic is the easiest path to a fully compatible cluster.

See the [official feature comparison](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/intro-aks-automatic#aks-automatic-and-standard-feature-comparison) for a complete breakdown of differences between AKS Automatic and AKS Standard.
